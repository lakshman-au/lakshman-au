The Cluster

    A swarm consists of one or more Docker nodes.
    Nodes are either a managers or a worker.
    Managers:
        Manage the state of the cluster
        Dispatch tasks to workers
    Workers:
        Accepts and execute tasks
    State is held in etcd
    Swarm uses Transport Layer Security (TLS):
        Encrypted communication
        Authenticated nodes
        Authorized roles

Orchestration

    The atomic unit of scheduling is a swarm service.
    The service construct adds the following to a container:
        scaling
        rolling updates
        rollback
        updates
    A container wrapped in a service is a task or a replica
	
sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.126.202	
sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0ipyse2k3fi0j42q85i43hdmglom9cdx4f0tz0m8ds1ch46i62-euy14g2mgz1pzrfap5seyd85r 172.31.126.202:2377
	
docker swarm join-token worker
     -> run in manager to get the token
	 
Create Service:

docker service create -d --name nginx_service -p 8989:80 --replicas 3 nginx:latest

List the swarm services:

docker service ls

Inspect nginx_service:

docker service inspect nginx_service

Find the network:

docker network ls --no-trunc | grep [NETOWRK_ID]

View the running tasks for nginx_service:

docker service ps nginx_service

Scale nginx_service to 3 replicas:

docker service scale nginx_service=3
