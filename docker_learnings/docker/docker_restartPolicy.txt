To configure the restart policy for a container, use the --restart flag:

    no: Do not automatically restart the container. (the default)
    on-failure: Restart the container if it exits due to an error, which manifests as a non-zero exit code.
    always: Always restart the container if it stops.
    unless-stopped: Similar to aways, except that when the container is stopped, it is not restarted even after the Docker daemon 
	restarts.
