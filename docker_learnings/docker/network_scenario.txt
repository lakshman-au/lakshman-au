You are developing a new containerized application for a client.
The application will consists of two containers: one for the frontend application, and one for the database.
Your client has security concerns about the database, 
and they want it to run on a private network that is not publicly accessible. 

docker network create frontend
docker network create backend --internal
docker container run -d --name database --network backend -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=P4ssW0rd0! mysql:5.7
docker container run -d --name frontend-app --network frontend nginx:latest
docker network connect backend frontend-app
